    <p><h4>Although I got the recipe for this cake from my mother, it primarily reminds me of my beloved grandmother and the rays of the summer afternoon sun. 
           I remember eating it for dessert as a child, spending holidays with my grandmother at our seaside cottage. 
           And although my grandmother baked it in a prodiz (because we had nothing else in the field), you can easily use the oven :) 
           <p>Enjoy!</p></h4></p>
