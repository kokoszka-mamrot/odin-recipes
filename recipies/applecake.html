         <p><h3>About the recipe</h3></p>
         <p>Although I got the recipe for this cake from my mother, it primarily reminds me of my beloved grandmother and the rays of the summer afternoon sun. 
           I remember eating it for dessert as a child, spending holidays with my grandmother at our seaside cottage. 
           And although my grandmother baked it in a prodiz (because we had nothing else in the field), you can easily use the oven :) 
           Enjoy!
