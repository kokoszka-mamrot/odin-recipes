    <p><h4>After a long and arduous search for the perfect bread recipe,
           I finally found it thanks to my friend Marta. 
           Apparently, it's a Thermomix recipe, but I prepare it "analog" :) and with a little twist, which Marta passed on to me.
           I assure you, there's nothing better than the smell of freshly baked bread!</h4></p>
